            <h2>The first trailer for Grand Theft Auto 6 is out. Here's why the hype is huge</h2>
            <img src="https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2023/12/05/gta-6-1--bdd616f1367b30a7d81343e9373e062216efc22a-s800-c85.webp" alt="Need for Spider-Man 2 Cover">
            <p>The title is pretty self explanatory. While the story changes with each version, the gameplay centers around doing crimes and wreaking havoc, like stealing cars, evading police and getting into shootouts.</p>

            <p>If you're an anxious type like myself, you can also just drive around like a law-abiding citizen in the fictional cities the games are centered in, which have drawn inspiration from places like San Francisco, Las Vegas and Los Angeles.</p>

            <p>Rockstar Games, the developer responsible for GTA, had to release the trailer a day earlier than planned because of a leak. The one-minute-30-second video confirms the game will be released in 2025 for the Playstation 5 and Xbox series X/S</p>

            <p>And it's not without its critics. For years, the game's allowed players to attend strip clubs, shoot civilians and rob stores â€” content that got the series temporarily banned for sale in Australia in 2001, with recent efforts springing up down under to ban the series again.</p>
